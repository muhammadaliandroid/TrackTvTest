## Synopsis

Worked on Trakt.Tv Api, which is interlinked with TMDB Api for Images using Kotlin to develop this Android Based Test.

## Why 2 APIs.

Since Trakt.Tv Api have stopped hosting images since 2016, I have seen ids for TMDB which i used to search Movie Details using TMDB API.

## Steps

Testing APIs.
Using Postman to have the right API Path for the Callbacks.
Used JUnit test to test these API Callbacks.
Created DataRepository which will cache both API Data and persist List of both into Realm DB.
